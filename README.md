# emerge-wics-23
Hackathon Project for UT Austin WiCS Hacks 2023!

EMERGE is a web platform where people in need of shelter/aid during emergencies (such as the power outages in Austin due to the ice storm of Winter 2023) can seek help from hosts who are available to provide aid in the form of food, shelter, supplies, etc.

Leverage the power of your community to help you emerge out of emergencies.
